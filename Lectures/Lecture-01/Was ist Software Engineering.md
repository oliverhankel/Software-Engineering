## Ein erster Blick auf Software Engineering

### Eine kurze Definition

“Software engineering is programming integrated over time.”[^1]


### Eine kurze Geschichte des Software Engineerings




### Warum wurde Software Engineering als Diszplin etabliert?

- When you're solving a problem that doesn't yet have a solution, what is a good process for building a solution?
- When software does so many different things, how can you know software "works"?
- How can you make progress when no one on the team understands every part of the program?
- When people leave a project, how do you ensure their replacement has all of the knowledge they had?
- When no one understands every part of the program, how do you diagnose defects?
- When people are working in parallel, how do you prevent them from clobbering each other's work?
- If software engineering is about more than coding, what skills does a good coder need to have?
- What kinds of tools and languages can accelerate a programmers work and help them prevent mistakes?
